Hello, I am Chuuya, a teenager on the internet who probably shouldn't be online but thats whatever.. I enjoy bsd, if you couldn't tell. 
I lack awareness or empathy so please be patient with me. (Autistic+Schizobpd).

Chuuya means a lot to me, being one of the only characters I've been able to form an attachment to.. Besides 18zai & Beastzai.
 Please do not be a Chuuya Nakahara pony around me, as I am him.

And please, do not talk about kinning, yuming, or anything suggestive about him near me, it makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Please respect this
or expect a hard block and possibly some not-so-kind words. ( I am not actually as mean as this makes me sound, I am just protective :sob:) Im not actually THIS serious.. js for effect
